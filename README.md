## Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on medical data. It uses the Cleveland dataset and implements three machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), TabNet, and Random Forest. The application is built using Django for the web interface and includes data visualization for better insights.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes SVM, TabNet, and Random Forest for accurate predictions.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly Django-based interface for inputting medical data.
- **Data Visualization**: Visual representations of data for enhanced understanding.
- **Static and Media Management**: Efficient handling of static and media files via Django settings.
